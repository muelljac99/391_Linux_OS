	IDT Initialization Function Ptr Array Const Bug #1; Found - 3/20/21 by Tim Green; Resolved - 3/20/21 by Tim Green
The idt should have descriptor entries filled with the function ptr to the assembly linkage code provided in irq_asm.S. I have been attempting to allow this ptr access through the use of an array of function ptrs. The array throws an error saying the elements are not constant. The function ptrs can be used as is within the idt_fill function and the idt test will pass but I don't want to have to type out all 256 function ptrs in the fill function.
I switched the array to be defined within the .S file instead of the .h file and using a list of longs directly in the file. This seems like a very inefficient method of creating these ptrs but I don't have any other ideas and this seems to work. Now need to finish the common_int function and start writing the do_irq function to handle exceptions, interrupts, and system calls.
